# Motivation

Shortly after moving to the Wissahickon neighborhood, I was looking for a detailed map of the Wissahickon Valley Park to plan some hikes and learn more about the woods. A lot of the maps I found through googling were either too detailed or not detailed enough, and almost none were interactive. One of the best maps I found was this one below - it has the right level of detail and big picture view I was looking for, but I never heard back from the creator about purchasing a print.

After some more goolging I found this [interactive map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=13bnd0IRNwzTpI7VFPASNSWXC5yk) created by the Friends of the Wissahickon. It has a lot of the park attrractions I was looking for in a map, but I really wanted to be able to make it my own and document my hiking loops, notes and tips. Rather than just make a copy of the Google map, I decided to create my own using `leaflet` and `R`.

# Data Prep

To get started, I created a copy of the Friends of the Wissahickon map and exported each layer (Kiosks, Parking, Trailheads...) as its own `.KMZ` file, then used https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/convert_input to convert the `.KMZ` file to `.GPX`. A `.GPX` file is basically `XML` flavored with some GPS data, so once I had the all of the `.GPX` files, I was able to use the amazing `XML` R package to parse the `XML`.

As someone used to working with dataframes, parsing XML in R can be tricky. There's lots of XML parsing posts out there but here's what worked for me:

 1. Understand the structure of the XML file
