<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Shortly after moving to the Wissahickon neighborhood, I was looking for a detailed map of the Wissahickon Valley Park to plan some hikes and learn more about the woods. A lot of the maps I found through googling were either too detailed or not detailed enough, and almost none were interactive. One of the best maps I found was this one below - it has the right level of detail and big picture view I was looking for, but I never heard back from the creator about purchasing a print.</p>

<p>After some more goolging I found this <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=13bnd0IRNwzTpI7VFPASNSWXC5yk">interactive map</a> created by the Friends of the Wissahickon. It has a lot of the park attrractions I was looking for in a map, but I really wanted to be able to make it my own and document my hiking loops, notes and tips. Rather than just make a copy of the Google map, I decided to create my own using <code>leaflet</code> and <code>R</code>.</p>

<h1>Data Prep</h1>
<p>To get started, I created a copy of the Friends of the Wissahickon map and exported each layer (Kiosks, Parking, Trailheads…) as its own <code>.KMZ</code> file, then used <a href="https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/convert_input" class="uri">https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/convert_input</a> to convert the <code>.KMZ</code> file to <code>.GPX</code>. A <code>.GPX</code> file is basically <code>XML</code> flavored with some GPS data, so once I had the all of the <code>.GPX</code> files, I was able to use the amazing <code>XML</code> R package to parse the <code>XML</code>.</p>
<p>As someone used to working with dataframes, parsing XML in R can be tricky. There’s lots of XML parsing posts out there but here’s what worked for me:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Understand the structure of the XML file</li>
</ol>
<p>the file</p>
