I am a senior clinical data analyst at the Center for Healthcare Quality and Analytics (CHQA) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where I get to apply my data analysis, statistics and visualization skills on a wide range of operational and quality improvement projects.


I enjoy working with stakeholders to make data operational - whether that means visualizing data in new and useful ways, using data to improve workflows (like automating a previously manual process) and or using predictive modelling to understand and anticipate patient flow.

When I'm not at work, you can find me on a bike or in the woods.
