      <description>&lt;p&gt;The RideTracker app was the first reactive data viz app I developed. It provides a way for me to track my training and commuting, in both a weekly snapshot view as well as over time, in ways that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt; user profile page doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I&amp;rsquo;d been seeing so many cool examples of Shiny apps and really wanted to make my own. I decided to make one using my Cycling data because I had just started to take training seriously and began racing competitively. I was looking for a way to analyze my training volume on a weekly basis and comparatively over time. The App is built on the &lt;code&gt;flexdashboard&lt;/code&gt; framework with a &lt;code&gt;Shiny&lt;/code&gt; reactive engine allowing me to dynamically filter the charts based on the sidebar inputs. I was able to retrieve my data using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rStrava&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;, and created all the charts using the  &lt;code&gt;highcharter&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about the development process on my &lt;a href=&#34;wwww.example.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
