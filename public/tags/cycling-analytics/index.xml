&lt;p&gt;This purpose of this app is to help cyclists review and analyze their interval workout to see if they hit the right numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;check-out-the-app-here-https-brndngrhm-shinyapps-io-myride&#34;&gt;Check out the app &lt;a href=&#34;https://brndngrhm.shinyapps.io/MyRide/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intervals are a common training method for cyclists, and are usually structured in an alternating easy/hard/easy/hard manner. A typical interval workout might be something like 10 minute warm up, 5 minutes @ 250 watts followed by 5 minutes @ 130 watts, repeated 4 times then followed by a 10 minute cool down. On an indoor trainer its pretty easy to pay attention during a workout and make sure your riding at the specified power or heart rate. But outdoors it&amp;rsquo;s much harder to keep a close eye on your cycling computer because you&amp;rsquo;ve got to be almost constantly scanning the road and your surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app allows a cyclist to analyze their intervals after their workout. You upload a workout, and the app applies a change-point detection algorithm which automatically identifies interval windows, and then takes an average over that window which the rider can then use to gauge if they rode at the specified power or heart rate during each interval.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://brndngrhm.shinyapps.io/RideTracker/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RideTracker&lt;/a&gt; app was the first reactive data viz app I developed. It provides a way for me to track my training and commuting, in both a weekly snapshot view as well as over time, in ways that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt; user profile page doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I&amp;rsquo;d been seeing so many cool examples of Shiny apps and really wanted to make my own. I decided to make one using my Cycling data because I had just started to take training seriously and began racing competitively. I was looking for a way to analyze my training volume on a weekly basis and comparatively over time. The App is built on the &lt;code&gt;flexdashboard&lt;/code&gt; framework with a &lt;code&gt;Shiny&lt;/code&gt; reactive engine allowing me to dynamically filter the charts based on the sidebar inputs. I was able to retrieve my data using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rStrava&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;, and created all the charts using the  &lt;code&gt;highcharter&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
